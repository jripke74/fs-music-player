# fs-music-player

In this workshop, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, and previous functionalities and dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

Step 1
In this workshop you will create a music player app capable of playing, pausing, and skipping songs from a playlist.

The HTML and CSS of this project have been provided for you, so you can focus on the JavaScript.

Start by accessing the #playlist-songs, #play, and #pause elements and assign them to the variables playlistSongs, playButton and pauseButton, respectively.
