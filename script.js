// Step 1
// In this workshop you will create a music player app capable of
// playing, pausing, and skipping songs from a playlist.

// The HTML and CSS of this project have been provided for you,
// so you can focus on the JavaScript.

// Start by accessing the #playlist-songs, #play, and #pause elements
// and assign them to the variables playlistSongs, playButton and
// pauseButton, respectively.

// Step 2
// Access the #next and #previous elements from the HTML file.

// Assign them to variables named nextButton, and previousButton,
// respectively.

const playlistSongs = document.getElementById("playlist-songs");
const playButton = document.getElementById("play");
const pauseButton = document.getElementById("pause");
const nextButton = document.getElementById("nest");
const previousButton = document.getElementById("previous");
